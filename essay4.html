        <h1 class="slide-in">DEMOCRATIZING AND MERITOCRATIZING EDUCATION AND TALENT RECRUITMENT</h1>
        <h2 class="slide-in">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">So, it’s no news that the current education and job recruitment systems are fundamentally flawed. Schools, especially the prestigious ones, often have outdated curriculums that are overly standardized, failing to cater to the unique abilities and interests of students. Moreover, access to quality education and opportunities is heavily influenced by financial status, leaving the less privileged at a significant disadvantage. Internships, application fees for competitions, and even fellowships that could enhance a student's qualifications are often out of reach for many. Similarly, the job market often favors connections over actual competence. It's time to democratize and meritocratize education and talent recruitment, ensuring that opportunities are based on merit and accessible to all.</p>

        <h2 class="slide-in">The Problem with Current Education</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">Let’s start with education. Education is not synonymous with schooling; it’s the process through which individuals learn and grow in a particular field. Historically, mentorship and apprenticeship were the primary means of learning. Proficient and recognized individuals in various fields were responsible for teaching aspirants. Today, however, teaching often becomes the fallback career for those who couldn’t succeed in their chosen professions. Why is this? The system has shifted, transforming schools into businesses rather than places of genuine learning.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">Schools used to be effective, but now over 70% of courses taught in colleges are overpriced and often unrelated to degree requirements. For instance, why should a course in cooking be a degree requirement? Furthermore, more than 60% of college graduates end up working in fields unrelated to their degrees, with many remaining jobless despite their qualifications. A survey of 3,000 students revealed that many hardworking students feel undervalued and underappreciated. They may look good on paper, but their actual worth and potential are not adequately recognized.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">We’ve heard countless stories of great minds who thrived outside the conventional education system, as well as tales of top students who struggled after school. The reasons for this are manifold [Here, delve deeper into the reasons, such as psychological factors, socioeconomic backgrounds, and systemic issues]. Until recently, these flaws in the education system were not as apparent, but the pandemic has brought them to light. Is school a scam? Not entirely. The problem lies in the current system on which schools operate. Schools have become businesses, and students are treated as sources of revenue rather than learners.</p>

        <h2 class="slide-in">Democratizing Education</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">During the COVID-19 lockdown, people had the opportunity to explore their interests and learn online. This period highlighted the potential of democratizing education—making knowledge accessible to everyone. People learned various skills online, from programming to graphic design, leading to a surge in online content creators and entrepreneurs. Democratizing education means making knowledge available to all, irrespective of formal schooling.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">However, a significant drawback of this approach is the quality and organization of learning materials. During the pandemic, many individuals had to sift through vast amounts of information without a structured learning path. This is where we come in. Our goal is to create a platform that organizes and provides quality educational resources, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to learn marketable skills. Schools may not teach you how to make money, but they can equip you with the skills necessary to succeed in your chosen field.</p>

        <h2 class="slide-in">Meritocratizing Education</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">Meritocratizing education involves ensuring that access to education and opportunities is based on merit rather than socioeconomic status. We all know celebrities whose children get into the best universities without earning their place. This system is deeply flawed, as it privileges the wealthy and connected over genuinely talented and hardworking individuals.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">Our surveys have shown that many students in prestigious universities do not even want to be there; they are there because of their parents’ status. Conversely, talented students from less privileged backgrounds often lack access to opportunities. This is where we need a fundamental shift.</p>

        <h2 class="slide-in">A New Solution</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">We propose a platform where people can learn, rank, and be recognized based on their abilities rather than their backgrounds. Imagine a platform where you can choose your field of interest—be it mathematics, physics, programming, or any niche area—and be ranked globally based on your performance. This platform would provide resources, schedule study plans, and offer challenges to help users improve their skills.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">Companies would also be part of this platform, posting questions and conducting interviews with users. This way, hiring would be based on actual competence rather than connections. Professors could test their theses and challenge users, making learning interactive and dynamic. Such a platform would revolutionize education and recruitment by focusing on skills and merit.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">Even if college applications remain unchanged, students can highlight their achievements on this platform, such as being the top-ranked solver in a specific subject. This would add substantial value to their applications and help them stand out based on their actual abilities.</p>
